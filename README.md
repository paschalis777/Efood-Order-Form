# Efood-Order-Form
This is a HTML code that displays a website for a pizza and pasta restaurant. The website includes a dropdown menu with different food categories, such as pizza, pasta, vegetables, and drinks. Upon selecting a category, food items belonging to that category are displayed as cards. The user can add items to their basket and see the total price. The website also includes buttons for navigating to the home page and for checking out.

The code imports the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript libraries, as well as the jQuery library. It defines an array of food items, which are displayed on the website dynamically using JavaScript. The website is also responsive to different screen sizes, as indicated by the viewport meta tag.
